    <p>This website is being built for a 2000's style website.
      It is still undergoing changes.

    <p>This is a changelog of everything I've done, on Jan 6 2024, the day I literally created the site (as of writing this that's the date, yes.)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Added buttons</li>
      <li>Added flag counter</li>
      <li>Added chatbox</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will add CSS (style) to my website soon, but I'm going to finish putting content up on my site first. </p>
